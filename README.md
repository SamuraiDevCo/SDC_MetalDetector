# SDC_MetalDetector

This script allows a you to place down or use existing native metal detectors like in real life! If a player walks through with a blacklisted item it will set off the metal detector. You can set a unlimited amount of items and a unlimited amount of spawned detectors. This script also uses a smart place/remove system to conserve resources while going around the city!
